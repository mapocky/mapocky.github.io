// Motivational video for myself

This article can come off as harsh in some parts, but I was writing it mainly for myself, and this attitude works the best for me, because it encourages me. Might not work for others and that is completely okey. Everyone is different. And maybe even I will be different after some time and this article will go through some changes. Looking forward to it.

# MOTIVATION: Why you should start doing things that you wanna do

### INDECISIVNESS

Dr. K explained it nicely in this video about indecisiveness. I will vaguely quote (it is not word by word) most interesting parts.:
 "How to make a good decision? What if I do the wrong decision? We are afraid of making the wrong decision." (...) "Trying to live perfect live. No decisions, no mistakes."

Recommendation: This is Why You're Indecisive (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNOQzE1XTdU)

Solution: "Go and do it".

1. Decide for one thing. 
2. If it doesn't work, go and do the second thing. 3. Do both.
4. Do the third one.

### OTHERS
Indentity based on how other's percieve you. How to get over that?

Create something and wait. If there is someone critizing, ask them to show you how to do it better. If they don't answer, they are just pussies. If they do answer, you get valuable lesson. "Others" are here to help you. "Pussies" are here to hurt you, because they are pussies and can do nothing. Who cares about pussies.

Solution:
Block close people out of your brain or embrace them. Show them or don't show them your work.

Others, that are not close to you, learn from them You block pussies or destroy them with your encouragement and success. 

The more you do for yourself, the less you will care about others. The most important opinion is yours.

## FEAR
•	[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXBgSCFOpPg) from older lady talking about fear.  
•	Do you wanna die without achieving anything, without living? You want to live just in your comfort zone with fear surounding you outside of that comfort zone, but not doing anything really?

### IT IS A PROCESS OR JOURNEY.
I never understood the "journey is the goal" saying. Huh... Well no, the goal is the goal. What do you mean?

It means, that the fun part is the process of building your project, the final product is nice, but the fun lays in the activity itself. When you achieve everything you wanted to achieve, what is next? Achievement and that's it. You then start thinking about new projects and new stuff you want to do, from different point of view, in different level, and you start another journey again. Because that is a human nature. We want to build, create, move, achieve another goal. We want to get better and better then our previous selves.

Example: 
When you are playing The Sims, you enjoy the game and you don't even have to finish it and achieve the Sim's career goal or relationship goal, because you had fun during the gaming.

## SMALL STEPS
Think about the final goal. Then write down the main tasks as levels in the game.. Then write down specific smaller tasks you gotta do to achieve that specific level.

Solution (example):

GOAL: Make interesting content
1. Write and article. 
    1.1. Figure out what to post?
    1.2.Find your niche?
        1.2.1. Write down my interests
        1.2.2. Pick one of these interests and try to write and article.
        1.2.3. If this interest is not good for you, try another one.

2. Create website
    2.1. Post an article
        2.1.1. Write and article
    2.2. Learn how to create the website
        2.2.1. Do research, how to create a website. Where to start?

3. Create video essay
    3.1. Create presentation, to organize your findings.

## YOU OWE IT TO THE PEOPLE
•	We owe it to people, that fought for us, to be free and have these possibilities. Men in the previous wars, men in today's fights, sufragettes etc. 
• We owe it to our ancestors' and relatives’s hardwork to get us where we are now.

## IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE "HIGH-VALUE"
- Sometimes "it" is being useful
- It is that you finish your school year and continue to finish your highschool
- It can be, that you make a dinner
- It can be the fact, that you build a nesting box
- Sometimes IT can mean something, that is bigger then you, but you take small steps. When you were a kid cooking dinner used to be "something bigger" and now look at you. 

## TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
So you can continue in this journey for a very long time. Or choose different.

Create habit out of stretching. Do it before brushing your hair or taking shower. Put it between habits you already have. You can't skip the new habit, you have to do it before the habit, that you are already used to.

Go to gym. Go for a walks in the forest. Go and go for a walk with your dog. Spend good time with friends and family.

#### You owe it to your future self
After 40s, there will be huge gap between those, who took care of their body and who did not.

## IT IS TOO LATE
I know a lady, who started studying university at 70 years old.

## WORRY
Imagine the worst scenarios, that can happen during the process of getting to the goal of yours. Then imagine the solutions. You will figure out, that everything can be solved and if not, you can just quit. That is also a solution. Just try it and start now.

## STOP AND APPRECIATE
Just stop, relax, look around and appreciate what you achieved and what you've done. Photos of your food, cleaned room, article you wrote, book you just finished reading.
