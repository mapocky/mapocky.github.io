I came across an online medival map from 1300. You can explore this map of inhabited part of the world (roughly equivalent to Europe, Asia and North Africa) yourself on [its website](https://www.themappamundi.co.uk/). Aside from mythical races (for example Sciapods, race of people with one huge foot, which they used as an umbrella), that are drawn on this map, there are also beasts, legends and biblical stories displayed.
