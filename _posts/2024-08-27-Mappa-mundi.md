I was researching mythical races and I came across an online medival map from 1300. You can explore this map of inhabited part of the world (roughly equivalent to Europe, Asia and North Africa) yourself on [its website](https://www.themappamundi.co.uk/). Aside from mythical races, that are drawn on this map, there are also beasts, legends and biblical stories displayed.
