This painting (1490) by Italian artist Domenico Ghirlandaio named An Old Man and his Grandson (Ritratto di vecchio con nipote) is unique, because it features the first known representation of a condition called "rhinophyma". The deformity on the old man's nose can be seen in the painting. I found out about this painting thanks to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6gKTy9oyhA), where is Dr. Lee treating her patient with the rhinophyma and helping him achieve better breathing with her procedure.

The painting itself is known for being very emotional, showing connection between the child and the man. The placement of child's hand on man's chest and the gentle look on man's face are signs of affection between these two characters, which was not really typical for traditional paintings.
