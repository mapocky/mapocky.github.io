				<title>Mappa Mundi, the Largest Medieval Map</title>
				
					<dc:creator>Daidarai</dc:creator>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;I was researching mythical races and I came across an online medival map from 1300. You can explore this map of inhabited part of the world (roughly equivalent to Europe, Asia and North Africa) yourself on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themappamundi.co.uk/&quot;&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from mythical races, that are drawn on this map, there are also beasts, legends and biblical stories displayed.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>This Devil Was Too Beautiful: The Satan statues by Geefs&apos; brothers</title>
				
					<dc:creator>Daidarai</dc:creator>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;The year is 1837 and the Belgian church just commissioned a devil sculpture for St. Paul’s Cathedral in Liége. The devil statue was meant to be part of an even bigger project — the new pulpit with theme “the Triumph of Religion over the Genius of Evil”. 
The sculptor Guillaume Geefs was put in charge of designing the pulpit. The creation of the devil sculpture was entrusted to Guillaume’s younger brother – Joseph Geefs. (…) And Joseph created one of the &lt;strong&gt;“most disturbing works of the period”&lt;/strong&gt;  – the Genius of Evil.&lt;/p&gt;
